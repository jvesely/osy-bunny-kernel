<h1>What is BunnyKernel?</h1>
<p>
BunnyKernel is an experimental operating system kernel implementation for MIPS R4000 processor. It was developed by the students of Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Its main aim as the semester work for Operating Systems  course is to explore the possibilities and demonstrate understanding of basic operating system programming techniques, the difference between application and kernel programming as well as the basic layout of an operating system.
The task was further simplified by using emulated environment provided by the MSIM software.
